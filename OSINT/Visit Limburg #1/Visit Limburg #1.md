 Visit Limburg #1
10

Welcome to Limburg! This beatiful province of Belgium offers so much to see and do!

Let's say you want to take a nice bike ride from one side to the other, but don't want to drive too much on roads where there are a lot of cars driving.

For this purpose we have a bike network! It tries to guide you as much as possible over smaller roads and bike paths where cars are not allowed to drive.

Let's start here:

The flag is the sum of all the nodes you pass on your trip (including the start and end nodes!)

Happy cycling!

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format


============================
Walkthrough:

This one is a little bit triky. The text talk about nodes. On the Google map, they don't have any numbers on white nodes. After google it, we found a website named:
https://fietsnet.be/routeplanner/default.aspx



The location field seems not worked. We need to do it manually. With Google map opened, we estimate the start node and the end node.

The full path has been automatically filled.

Here is the path:
