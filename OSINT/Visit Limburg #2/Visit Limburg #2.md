 Visit Limburg #2 (20 pts)

I'm supposed to meet up with my buddy who supplies me with Twilight cd's but he's very cryptic about the meeting location.

He told me he will meet under a bridge that sits in the middle of a triangle of 3 locations.

The first two locations are the two mineshafts of the coalmines in the province that are the furthest appart from each other.

The third location is where the provided (hazy) picture was taken

Please provide the date that was written under the bridge (format #.##.## where # is a digit) in 2013

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format


============================
Walkthrough:

We need to find three locations. First, get started with the picture. Colors Has been removed and little bit blured but we can see that its a church. After a google church limburg on google Image, we get the same church. It is a transparent church at the location:
Doorkijkkerk - Reading between the lines

For the two others locations, we need to find two mineshafts in the limburg province where are the furthest appart from each other.


We found the following paper about the Limburg Mining Region:
https://www.erfgoedcelmijnerfgoed.be/wp-content/uploads/De-Limburgse-mijnstreek-LR.pdf

It is in dutch but, it is possible to get the name of each location/zone in the title started at page 14.

Using google map, the two locations is:
BERINGEN and EISDEN

Using Google map to pin out theses three location, we found the middle in the triangle. We have two bridge closer. One of these bridge has the date:
