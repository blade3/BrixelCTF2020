Manhunt #8 (5 pts)

so now you know where he lives, can you tell me what was written on his wall in 2013?

This flag is not in the usual format, you can enter it with or without the brixelCTF{flag} format, replace spaces with underscores ('_')

This is part of a series, more challenges will be unlocked once you solve this one. While most challenges will be OSINT, some of them may not be.


============================

Walkthrough:

this is the eighth part of the Manhunt series. We suspect that is related on real life. On google map, you are able to find an old street view ([Here is the google map link](https://goo.gl/maps/Sm33SNWcaCWUPyKt9)). On the right side of this building, we can read the following:
```
JUST MARRIED
```

The flag is:
```
JUST_MARRIED
```
